```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dslabs)
library(tidyverse)
data(heights)
```

## 1. Count measurements for each sex

```{r}
male <- heights$height[heights$sex == "Male"]
female <- heights$height[heights$sex == "Female"]
length(male)
length(female)
```

## 2. Percentile comparison

```{r}
female_percentiles <- quantile(female, probs = c(0.10, 0.30, 0.50, 0.70, 0.90))
male_percentiles <- quantile(male, probs = c(0.10, 0.30, 0.50, 0.70, 0.90))
data.frame(Female = female_percentiles, Male = male_percentiles)
```

## 3–7. Answering from Boxplot

**3.** Asia has the country with the biggest population.  
**4.** Americas has the largest median population.  
**5.** Median population for Africa ≈ 13 million.  
**6.** b. 0.75  
**7.** Africa has the largest IQR after log transformation.

## 8. Proportion of Male Heights between 69 and 72 inches

```{r}
x <- heights$height[heights$sex == "Male"]
mean(x > 69 & x <= 72)
```
